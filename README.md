gifBooth 
========
An animated gif photo booth

Requirements
========
SimpleCV - http://www.simplecv.org/
Python 2.7



Usage
========
`Left Mouse Button` - Record gif

`Right Mouse Button` - Change time delay between each gif frame. The range of options is between 0.1 seconds (10 FPS) to 1 second (1 FPS). 

`Escape Key` - Exit gifBooth

Notes
========
Installing SimpleCV on Mac 10.7 was the most grueling part of this project. If I were doing this again I would just use OpenCV. That being said, SimpleCV does have some nice features that can make some projects easier.
